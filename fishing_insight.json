  "content": "In the waters off northern Japan, a fishing vessel appears to have been detected operating within 100 meters of a Marine Protected Area boundary at coordinates [143.2676, 44.4631]. This proximity suggests the vessel may be engaging in 'fishing the line' - a practice where fishers operate as close as possible to protected area boundaries to target fish that aggregate along these edges. While this activity occurs in legal waters, it raises questions about the effectiveness of buffer zones around marine sanctuaries.",
