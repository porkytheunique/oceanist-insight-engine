  "content": "A fishing vessel was detected off the northwestern coast of Spain, near the region of Galicia. The vessel was observed at the exact boundary of a Marine Protected Area (MPA), a distance of 0.00 km from its limits. This practice is known as 'fishing the line,' where vessels operate as close as legally possible to protected areas. Such behavior can potentially undermine conservation efforts by targeting fish that move in and out of the protected zone.",
