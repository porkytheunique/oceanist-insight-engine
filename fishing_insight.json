  "content": "The most active fishing zone corresponds to Taiwan's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), with 2,714 recorded fishing events. This EEZ encompasses critical fishing grounds in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding waters, supporting both commercial and subsistence fishing operations that are vital to Taiwan's maritime economy. An Exclusive Economic Zone extends up to 200 nautical miles from a country's coastline, granting that nation exclusive rights to explore, exploit, and manage marine resources including fish stocks. The high activity in this zone reflects Taiwan's significant role in regional fisheries and the productive nature of these western Pacific waters.",
