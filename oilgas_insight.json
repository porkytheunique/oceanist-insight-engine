  "content": "The 'Morgan' oil and gas platform in Egyptian waters is operating just 8.65 km from a coral reef in the Northern and Central Red Sea ecoregion. This proximity raises concerns about potential environmental impacts on the fragile marine ecosystem. Offshore oil and gas infrastructure can pose significant risks to coral reefs, including the possibility of oil spills, contamination from drilling muds, and disruption from noise pollution. These threats could lead to long-term damage to the biodiversity and health of the nearby coral reef system.",
