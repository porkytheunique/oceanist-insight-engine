  "content": "The Salsa (GB171) - Hess oil and gas platform, located in United States waters in the Southern Gulf of Mexico ecoregion, operates approximately 630.8 km from a coral reef ecosystem. While this distance provides some buffer, offshore fossil fuel infrastructure can pose environmental risks to fragile marine ecosystems through potential oil spills, chemical discharges, and operational pollution. These risks can affect water quality and marine biodiversity across vast ocean areas, potentially impacting coral reefs and other sensitive habitats even at considerable distances. Continuous monitoring and strict environmental protocols are essential to minimize potential impacts on these vulnerable ecosystems.",
