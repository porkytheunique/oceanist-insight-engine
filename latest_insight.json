  "content": "A fishing vessel was detected directly on the boundary of a Marine Protected Area (MPA). This observation is an example of 'fishing the line', a common practice where vessels concentrate their efforts just outside protected areas. This behavior occurs because fish populations often thrive within MPAs and spill over into adjacent waters, creating prime fishing grounds. However, this intense fishing pressure at MPA boundaries can potentially undermine conservation efforts and put protected ecosystems at risk.",
