Researchers found that coral cover declined from 60% in 2004 to just 11% in 2022, with the most dramatic losses occurring in the past five years. This alarming decline is attributed to various factors including climate change, overfishing, and pollution from coastal development. The findings highlight the urgent need for improved management and conservation efforts in marine protected areas.",
